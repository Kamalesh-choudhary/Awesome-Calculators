# ⚡ Ohm’s Law Calculator (Python)

A lightweight command-line tool that calculates Voltage (V), Current (I), or Resistance (R) using Ohm’s Law.

🔧 Features :

Compute:

V = I × R

I = V ÷ R

R = V ÷ I

Accepts both uppercase & lowercase options (V, I, R)

Clean, modular structure using Python functions

Handles division by zero and invalid inputs gracefully

🚀 How to Run

# Navigate to the project folder

cd OhmLawCalculator-Python-NikhilYadav04

# Run the program

python main.py

🧮 Example
Enter your choice (V/I/R): i
Enter Voltage (V): 12
Enter Resistance (R): 4
As per formula I = V / R = 3.00 A

🧠 Requirements

Python 3.6+

Works in any terminal (no external libraries)

⚠️ Notes

Input validation for non-numeric values is included.

Script can be easily extended or integrated into larger projects.
